                <p>
                    I may collect data in the form of analytics or usage data from my website to better understand my visitors and to improve my website.
                    <!--
                    I don’t want anyone feeling unsure of how their data is being handled.
                    Therefore, I decided to use Hotjar for analytics, which respects Your browser's “Do Not Track” setting and where You can opt-out at any time.

                <h3>Analytics Data via Hotjar</h3>
                <p>
                    I use Hotjar in order to better understand my visitors' needs and to optimize my website and experience.
                    Hotjar is a technology service that helps me better understand my visitors' experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables me to build and maintain my website with user feedback.
                    Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on my users' behavior and their devices.
                    You can instruct Your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent.
                    The collected data includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display my website.
                    Hotjar stores this information on my behalf in a pseudonymized user profile for a maximum of twelve months.
                    Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on my behalf.
                </p>
                <p>For further details, please see the ‘about Hotjar’ section of <a href="https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/categories/115001323967-About-Hotjar">Hotjar’s support site <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
                <p>
                    You may opt-out from having Hotjar collect Your information when visiting my website at any time by visiting their <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out">Opt-out page <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and clicking ‘Disable Hotjar’.
                    Hotjar respects Your Browser's “Do Not Track” (DNT) setting.
                    If You have DNT enabled, the opt-out is not necessary.
                </p>

                <h3>Usage Data</h3>
                <p>

                    I may also collect information that Your browser sends whenever You visit my website or when You access it by or through a mobile device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I may use the above mentioned Personal Data to provide, maintain, and improve my website, including the monitoring of its usage.
                    I will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes.
                    Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security of my website or I am legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

                <p>
                    The security of Your personal data is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
                    While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your personal data, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
